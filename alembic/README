# Alembic Migrations Directory

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

## Quick Start

### Initialize (already done):
```bash
alembic init alembic
```

### Create a new migration:
```bash
# Autogenerate from models
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"

# Create empty migration
alembic revision -m "Description"
```

### Apply migrations:
```bash
# Upgrade to latest
alembic upgrade head

# Upgrade one version
alembic upgrade +1

# Downgrade one version
alembic downgrade -1

# View current version
alembic current

# View migration history
alembic history
```

### Common Commands:
```bash
# Check for pending migrations
alembic current
alembic heads

# Run specific migration
alembic upgrade <revision_id>

# Rollback to specific version
alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```

## Migration Files Best Practices

1. Always review autogenerated migrations
2. Test migrations in development first
3. Keep migrations atomic (one logical change per migration)
4. Include both upgrade() and downgrade() functions
5. Add comments for complex operations
6. Never edit applied migrations, create new ones
